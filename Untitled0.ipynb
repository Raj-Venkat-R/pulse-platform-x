The project successfully built a conceptual framework for a multimodal AI diagnostic model, including data handling, model architecture, training, evaluation, explainability, reporting, and deployment considerations.\n","*   The primary technical hurdle identified is the lack of GPU availability, which will significantly impact training time and feasibility with large datasets. A next step is to ensure a GPU-enabled environment is available for actual model training.\n"]}]}
